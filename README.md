# Teleport Bow
Teleport Bow is a simple teleportation Spigot plugin. It allows you to teleport to the place your arrow landed.

## Compatibility
This plugin is currently compatible with Minecraft 1.17, however,
other versions that use the same Spigot API should _technically_ work.
I will soon test out the plugin in different Minecraft Versions and list
the versions TeleportBow is compatible with.

## Installation
Download the plugin from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/TeleportBow/releases).
Make sure to select the compatible version. If you cannot find a compatible version,
read the [Support Section](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/TeleportBow#support).
Make sure to read the [Note](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/TeleportBow#note) and the [Disclaimer](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/TeleportBow#disclaimer) before installation.


Installation of the plugin is straight forward and is similar to rest of the
other plugins. Simply drag and drop the appropriate version of
`.jar` file into your server's `plugin` folder.
No configuration required, and the plugin will not create a folder or
any sort of configuration files such as `config.yml`.

You will need at least [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html) or above to run this plugin, otherwise it may cause errors.

## Permissions
- `tpbow.getbow` allows user to run /tpbow and get the teleportation bow.
- `tpbow.teleport` allows user to teleport to the place the arrow landed. If the player doesn't have the permission,
they will not be teleported.
- `tpbow.bowonjoin` gives the user the teleportation bow and arrow on join. You can assign this permission to default group.
- `tpbow.nofall` disables fall damage.

## Support
If you come across a bug or an unexpected behavior, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/TeleportBow/issues)
or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MmqXcebnxC) and let me know about it. Please make sure
to include how to reproduce the bug or the issue.

Also, if you want me to make minor modifications for you, such as making the plugin for other Minecraft Versions such as 1.12.2,
feel free to let me know by joining  the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MmqXcebnxC).
I will try my best to compile a custom `.jar` for you.  I will also provide you the source code if you want.

### Disclaimer
__I do not recommend using this plugin for an active/public server.__ There are many issues which I don't have the time to fix.
There are many other similar plugins out there, which are way better than this plugin, although they may not be Open Source.
I decided to publish this plugin cause some people may find the code useful and would assist them making a better one.
You may also fork the repository and make a better one with much more features and fixes.
If you still decide to use it on an active/public server, do it on your own risk.

### Note
This repository's code is made for the Spigot API Minecraft 1.17. Other versions may be compatible too, but not
all. I will soon test out the `1.17 jar` with other versions of Minecraft and update here what versions the `1.17 jar` is
compatible with!

If you liked my plugin, please make sure to star my repository, as it will
help other people discover my plugin, and I'd really appreciate it!
